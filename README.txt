The data processing was done in python, while model merging the datasets, exploratory analysis and model implementation  was done in R version 4.0.5.
The shared files consists of the following; 

1. "Data processing codes";  This code entails importing the african shapefile and gridding to 5 by 5 kilometers to obtain the centoids, which are then used for extracting point data from environmental variable rasters. Further the code entails importing the rasters, clipping to african area, reprojection and resampling, and point data extraction based on the centroids, for each timestep withing the time scope. Further, the code entail point data extraction from the rasters based on vectors occurence data. We have provided the links to the raster data source in the manucsript (Appendix A). These rasters are freely available without any restrictions. The resulting were appended serially for each variable, and shared together with the vector occurence data sets at the icipe data repository (https://dmmg.icipe.org/dataportal/dataset/). These datasets are used as inputs for model implementation.  
2. "Exploratory data analysis": This file contains the codes for data exploration. The input data is "species occurence data EDA" shared at the icipe data repository
3: "Model implementation codes" : This file contains codes for model implementation in R. The code involves importing variables processed data and the vector occurence data (all shared at https://dmmg.icipe.org/dataportal/dataset/spatio-temporal-dynamics-of-malaria-vector-niche-overlaps-in-africa) into R software, converting data into spatial dataframe, model implementation, and exporting the model outputs inform of rasters. The model outputs are shared in file named "model_output_rasters.zip".  
4: Other file shared here include the "Africa Shapefile & Africa_5KM_grid" and "Model output rasters".  "Africa Shapefile & Africa_5KM_grid" file contains the shapefile of Africa and gridded Africa while "Model output rasters" file contains the raster outputs for the years 1985-2021 in .tif format.
